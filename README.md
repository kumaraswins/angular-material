This repository will explain step by step development of client side application from the scratch. Each step will be maintained in the separate branch.

Step1 branch contains the basic folder structure and the prerequisite files for working of the basic application

Step2 branch contains the routing part of the application. Here the state provider has beed used for the routing. Why here the state provider is user here because we can maintain the ui based on the conditons without any mess. For example, the nav bar should not be displayed in the login screen, without any complex logic we can add the UI based on the routes.
